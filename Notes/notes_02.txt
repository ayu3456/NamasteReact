These are the notes of episode 2 
Now i am making the notes here only (Igniting the app)

React is not alone -> LIbraies -> to make an app fast 

The HTML CSS JS FILE IS NOT PRODUCTION READY. WE NEED TO DO A LOT OF WORK LIKE IMAGE OPTIMATION, CHUNKING, COMMENTS REMOVE ,BUNDLE, CONSOLE.LOG HATANE HOTE HAI. YE SAB KAM APNE AAP CREATE React APP KARKE RAKHTA HAI

NPM -> EVERYTHING BUT NOT NODE PACKAGE MANAGER (IT MANAGE PACKAGES BUT IT DOES NOT STAND FOR NODE PACKAGE MANAGER) STANDARND REPOSITARY FOR ALL PACKAGE MANAGER.

WHEN YOU RUN NPM INIT -> GIVE ANSWERS TO LOT OF CHINDI QUESTION AND IN THE RESULT WE GET PACKAGE.JSON FILE. 

PACKAGE.JSON -> IS THE CONFIGURATION FOR THE NPM. THIS APP IS DEPENDENT ON A LOTS PACKAGE CALLED DEPENDENCY. PACKAGE.JSON ME SARI DEPENDENCY STORE RAHTI HAI VERSION KE SATH.
IT KEEPS THE TRACK OF WHAT VERSION OF PACKAGE IS INSTALLED ON THE SYSTEM.

INSTALL THE DEPENDENCY 
BUNDLER -> MOST IMPORTANT PACKAGE .OUR  WHOLE CODE NEEDS TO BE CACHED , BUNDLED TOGETHER, MINIFIED, OPTIMATISED, CLEANED BEFORE SET IT INTO PRODUCTION. EG WEBPACK,VITE, ETC

CRA -> USES WEBPACK 
PARCEL HAM USE KARENGE STRNGHT DEGA 

There are two types of DEPENDENCY
DEV DEPENDENCY - IT IS ONLY REQUIRED IN DEVELOPEMENT PHASE 
NORMAL DEPENDENCY - ALSO USED IN PRODUCTION.

`npm install -D parcel ` -> to install parcel ->   

`^` WHAT IS THE USE OF THIS ? -> CARET
THIS IS USED FOR AUTOMETICALLY UPDATE THE PACKAGE TO ITS NEW MINOR VERSION. 

`~` THIS IS USED FOR AUTOMETICALLY UPDATE THE PACKAGE TO ITS NEW MAJOR VERSION. 

WHAT IS PACKAGE LOCK.JSON ?
IT KEEPS THE TRACK OF EXACT VERSION OF DEPENDENCY THAT IS BEING INSTALLED.
IT LOCKS THE VERSION AND KEEP THE RECORD OF IT. 

NODE_MODULE -> CONTAINS ALL THE CODE THAT WE FETCHED FROM NPM. 

TRANSITIVE DEPENDENCY -> A DEPENDENCY CAN DEPEND ON MANY SUCH DEPENDENCY.
THAT IS WHY NODE_MODULE IS SO HEAVY 

HOW PARCEL MANAGES ALL THIS ? 
EVERY DEPENDENCY HAVE ITS OWN PACKAGE.JSON. IT IS MAINTAINING ITS OWN DEPENDENCY.

SHOULD I PUT PACKAGE.JSON / PACKAGE.JSON ON THE GITHUB ? YES. IF YOU HAVE PACKAGE.JSON -> YOU CAN RECREATE THE NODE_MODULE  

npx -> its means executing the PACKAGE 

WHEN WE RUN THIS CMD npx parcel index.html , IT GOES TO THE SRC FILE AND CREATE A BUILD FOR THE SRC FILE TO LOCALHOST 1234. 

FEACHING REACT FROM CDN IS NOT THE GOOD WAY. BECAUSE IT TAKES COSTLY OPERATIONS. 
INSTALL REACT AS  NPM PACKAGE   

WHEN YOU RUN THIS CMD npx parcel build index.html. PARCEL BUNDLE MINIFIED THE APP AND PUT ALL THIS TO DIST FOLDER. IT MINIFIED ALL THE FILES TO THESE 3 FILES ... 

To make our app supportable in Older VERSION We use BrowserList. 
it is a npm PACKAGE 

you have to change PACKAGE.json for that 
"browserList":[
    "last 2 chrome version",
    "last 2 firefox version"
]
