Earlier we learnt about monolithic and microservice architechture. 
Notes are in textcopy. 

Now we are going to fetch the from the swiggy live api and render the data into frontend. 

2 Approaches for fetching the data. 

1: As soon as our webpage loads we make an api call to fetch the data.
    LOADS -> API -> RENDER (suppose it takes 500ms to render)
    then our page will wait for 500ms then render the UI. Our page will be frozen till 500ms.

2:  LOADS -> RENDER -> API 
    We will re-render the app with new Data and populate the app with data from the     backend.

Q: We will be using 2nd approach why ? 
A: Better User Experience. Some portion is visible from the beginning. Although it render the cycle twice but react's render cycle are very fast. 

* INTRODUCTION TO USEFFECT HOOK.
     It has two arguments, 
     1. Callback function
     2. Dependency Array. 

useEffect(()=>{},[]) 
when will this useEffect callback function is called ? 
the useEffect is called after the component renders (e.g) when the body component loads

when the body component loads as soon as render cycle is finished this callback fn is called.  

we have succussfully made an api call and render the data on the ui.

now we can delete the mockData

Api are taking some time to load to enhance the user Experience. 
Loader laga do. 

But we are using Shimmer UI to increase the User Experience. We will create a fake cards to display the UI until the data is not present.
