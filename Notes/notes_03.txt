// In-Line Style are given in the form of JS objects.

// you can do destructuring it



we should the script in package.json to make it easy to run. 

React.createElement => Object when we render on DOM => It become an HTML Element.

React package is used only on creating element for displaying it to web we need ReactDom

this syntax is very bad. it is very clumsy. It is also not very developer friendly. 
therefore react developer create jsx whose syntax is similar to HTML.

JSX is not the part of react. 
we can write react without jsx. It is type of convention where we merge html and js.  

JS code is such that code any js engine understand. 
can js engine understand jsx code ?? NO 
this is not valid JS. when you run on browser you will get error. 

jsx code -> transpiled (done by parcel) -> then goes to js engine.
Parcel itself is not doing transpilation. it is done by babel. 

babel is JS compiler.it converts the JSX code that browser understand. 
jsx (babel) => React.createElement => ReactElement(JS Object) => HTML element. 

any attribute written in jsx is in CamelCase. 

// React Component 
// Class based Component (old way)
// Functional Component (new way) 

Functional component -> it is just a normal js function which return a react element

inside the Functional Component you can write any JS code inside the curly bracket.
