Make Separate Files for Separate Component.

We are going to learn react Hook 

Never write any hardcoded data in the component folder.  

there are two types of export/import. 
one is when u have to export single function -> export default component name 
other way is  when u have to export multiple functions -> named export ka use karte hai.

named wale import ke samne {} lagte hai. 

eg export const Component;
import {Component} from "path"
