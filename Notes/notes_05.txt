UI Library and Framework make developer experience easy. It help us doing a lot of work in very less code. 

Make Separate Files for Separate Component.

We are going to learn react Hook 

Never write any hardcoded data in the component folder.  

there are two types of export/import. 
one is when u have to export single function -> export default component name 
other way is  when u have to export multiple functions -> named export ka use karte hai. 

write export in front of variable and constants. 
named wale import ke samne {} lagte hai. 

eg export const Component;
import {Component} from "path"

Now we are going to make our website interactive (dynamic).
Handle a Click-Event onClick = {cb function}

How is the website become dynamic ?
onclick of the button if the data getting changed data increases or desceses. 

DATA HAI RESLIST ME -> RESLIST KO CHANGE KARNE PAR WEBPAGE CHANGE HO JAYEGA.
TO HAM FILTER KARENGE RESLIST. AUR DATA KAM KARENGE.  

seekhne ke liye sabse pahele ek listOfResturant name ka ek js variable banaya .usme mock data dala,fir usse map function ka use karke render karaya . button ke on click par 
filter ka logic likha hai. aur fir use console kara ke dekha hai. 

console par data to filter ho gaya par UI update nahi hua hai. why ?? 

Jab listOfResturant change ho raha hai to UI update kyu nahi ho raha hai. 
Yahi kam react karke deta hai. (Agar ham bolrahe hai react Fast hai to react dom manipulation me fast hai)

React makes data layer consistent with UI layer. 
- Faster and Efficient DOM Manipulation. 

To do this react gives us SuperPower (Hooks)

Q: What is a React Hook ? 
A: Normal JS function which is given to us by react.Function which has some logic written behind the scene. 

There are two very important hooks 
1: useState() -> SuperPower State Variable in React. 
2: useEffect() -> 

Q: Why it is called State Variable ? 
A: because it maintain the state of our application. Scope iska bhi inside the component hoga. 

when u call the useState hook is give a state variable . you have to recieve it inside a array. 

eg const [listOfResturants,setListOfResturants] = useState(# yaha par default value jati hai);

modify(update) karne ke liye hame ek function (setListOfResturants) ki need hoti hai. 

we will call the setListOfResturant and pass the new data we wish to add. 

WHENEVER THE State Variable CHANGE REACT RE-render THE COMPONENT.

React is only good at dom operations . bahut jaldi dom operations karta hai. 
It keeps the data layer in sync with UI Layer.
