HOW DOES A REACT APP BUILD ?? WHAT IS THE THOUGHT PROCESS BEHIND THE WEBAPP ?
A: EXPLORE THE APP -> PLANNING (IF YOUR PLANNING IS GOOD CODE IS VERY EASY)

PLANNING -> WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO BUILD (YE PATA HONA CHAHIYE) -> UI DESIGN MOCK 

COMPONENT:
1): HEADER
    - LOGO 
    - LINKS (NAV ITEMS)

2): BODY: 
    -SEARCH
    -RESTURANT CONTAINER 
        -RESTURANT CARDS  

3): FOOTER 
    -COPYRIGHT 
    -LINKS 
    -ADDRESS 

Inline Styles in react are given in the form of JS Object and if u want to apply any inline style u need {} to write using style attribute.  

How we can make our card dynamic ? 
first card -> meghna food 
second card should be of kfc 

YAHA PAR AATA HAI PROPS KA CONCEPT (PROPS = PROPERTY) 
PROPS ARE THE SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN PASS TO THE COMPONENT.

COMPONENT KYA HAI -> JS FUNCTION HAI. 
WAISE HI PROPS KYA -> ARGUMENTS HAI.

CONFIG DRIVEN UI -> eg: Different OFFERS ARE THERE IN Different CITES . SO COROUSEL MAY CHANGE. THERE MIGHT BE CHANCE THAT THERE IS NO COROUSEL.(NO OFFERS)

OUR WEBSITE IS DRIVEN BY DATA. 
CONTROLLING THE UI USING DATA(CONFIG) WHICH IS COMING FROM BACKEND.  

Always give key while looping. Why ?? 
Ans: If u dont pass the keys react will re-render Everything. It helps in Optimisation of Webpage. It does not know which card is new here. 
Some people use index as a key. but react says never use index as key
